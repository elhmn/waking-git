# waking-git
Git world generator. `waking-git` uses the code structure, and evolution of
your git repository to generate a world for you to explore.

The program will scan your repository, and extract from its directory and code structure
revelant data that can be used to generate a 2D/3D playable world/game. The structure
of your code (Intefaces, Classes, functions etc...) can be used to create living creatures.
Those creatures can be mobs/enemies depending on how well their structure match well known
code smell, in the programming language the code is written on.

## Little shmup example (WIP)

Here is work in progress shmup game that is currently being built on the `implement-a-shmup-demo` branch:

## Development
The project is built in `rust`, and uses git as a strong dependency.

### Dependencies
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Architecture

Please read the draft of the [architecture](https://github.com/elhmn/waking-git/blob/main/docs/Architecture.md).

### How to run ?

In order to run `waking-git` you need to [install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) the rust tool chain.

**How to scan a repository ?**

```console
$ cargo run -p wake -- scan https://github.com/elhmn/waking-git
```

**How to play ?**

First make sure to build and install the players using the following command:

```console
$ make build-players && make install-players
```

Then you can run the player using the following command:

```console
$ cargo run -p wake -- play shmup https://github.com/elhmn/waking-git
```

How to run the server ?

```console
$ cargo run -p wake serve -p 3000
```

You could request data from the server using the following command:
```console
$ curl -X GET -vsS -d '{"repo_url": "https://github.com/elhmn/cgit"}' \
	-H 'Content-Type: application/json' localhost:3000/scan/extracted | jq
```

The server supports the following routes:

- `GET /scan/extracted` - Extract data from a repository
- `GET /scan/converted` - Convert extracted data to a world representation
- `GET /scan` - Scan a repository and return a tarball containing extracted and converted data

### How to test ?

Run the entire test suite using,
```console
$ make test
```

Check linting
```console
$ make lint
```

Check code format
```console
$ make fmt
```

Setup git local hooks
```console
$ make install-hooks
```

### More

You can run `make` OR `make help` to find out more commands
```console
$ make
 You can build `wake` using `make build`
 or run an example using `make run`

 Choose a command...
  build             build application binary.
  run               run an example.
  serve             start the wake server.
  build-wake        build wake binary.
  install-players   install players binary.
  build-players     build players binary.
  test              run tests
  lint              run linter over the entire code base
  lint-players      run linter over the playersÂ workspace
  lint-wake         run linter over the wake workspace
  fmt               check your code format
  install-hooks     install local git hooks

You could run it using cargo commands directly

Make sure to build and install the player before running it:
`make build-players ; make install-players`

Then run: `cargo run -p wake -- play shmup https://github.com/elhmn/waking-git`

Scan a repo:
`cargo run -p wake -- scan https://github.com/elhmn/waking-git`

Run the player:
`cargo run -p players -- shmup /Users/elhmn/.wake/scanner/github-com-elhmn-waking-git/shmup-converted.json`
```
